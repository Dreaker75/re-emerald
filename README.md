# Pokemon Re:Emerald

 - A QoL hack for Pokemon Emerald based on pokeemerald Expansion that tries to keep the essence of vanilla Emerald while at the same time fixing a lot of the outdated mechanics.
 - This hack will have all Pokemon, sprites, attacks, items, etc **as they appeared in vanilla Emerald** and only updates QoL stuff like breeding mechanics, EVs, etc.
 - This will be a 386-Romhack that will have repeatable methods to get every item in-game, as well as try to fix the Battle Frontier economy, among many other things.

# pokeemerald Expansion

## What is the pokeemerald Expansion?

The pokeemerald Expansion is a feature branch meant to be integrated into existing Pokémon Emerald hacks based off pret's [pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) decompilation project. This is ***NOT*** a standalone romhack, and as such, most features will be unavailable and/or unbalanced if played as is.

## What features are included?
 - Pressing B while holding a Pokémon drops them like in modern games (configurable).
 - Running indoors (configurable).
 - Reusable TM.
 - B2W2+ Repel system
 - Gen6+'s EV cap.
 - All bugfixes from pret included.


    
## If I already have a project based on regular pokeemerald, can I use the pokeemerald Expansion
Yes! Keep in mind that we keep up with pret's documentation of pokeemerald, which means that if your project a bit old, you might get merge conflicts that you need to solve manually.
- If you haven't set up a remote, run the command `git remote add RHH https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion`.
- Once you have your remote set up, run the command `git pull RHH master`.

With this, you'll get the latest version of the Expansion, plus a couple of bugfixes that haven't been released into the next patch version :)

## **How do I update my version of the pokeemerald Expansion?**
- If you haven't set up a remote, run the command `git remote add RHH https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion`.
- Once you have your remote set up, run the command `git pull RHH expansion/1.6.2`.
