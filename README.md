# Pokemon Re:Emerald

 - A QoL hack for Pokemon Emerald based on pokeemerald Expansion that tries to keep the essence of vanilla Emerald while at the same time fixing a lot of the outdated mechanics.
 - This hack will have all Pokemon, sprites, attacks, items, etc **as they appeared in vanilla Emerald** and only updates QoL stuff like breeding mechanics, EVs, etc.
 - This will be a 386-Romhack that will have repeatable methods to get every item in-game, will try to fix the Battle Frontier economy, and many other things.

## pokeemerald-expansion options:
 - Most of the out-of-battle mechanics have been updated to be the best QoL versions of themselves (Like the Gen VI Exp. Share), with some exceptions:
    - The overworld Poison effect has been left alone and can still faint your Pokemon outside of battle
 - Most of the in-battle mechanics have been left alone and work exactly like they did in vanilla Emerald, with some exceptions:
    - A Pokemon can now evolve after a battle even if it has fainted.
    - The player now loses money like in later games after losing a battle, rather than losing half their money.
    - Unevolved Pokemon that evolve through level now get bonus experience if they're past their level requirement.
    - All EVs now cap at 252, rather than 255, and the stats are recalculated after every battle, even at level 100.
    - All non-berry items are restored after battle.
    
## Custom changes:
 - Rock Smash rocks will either trigger a wild Pokemon battle, or they won't (No more random chance to trigger an encounter. If a rock doesn't give you an encounter, it never will)
 - Rock Smash rocks that block the path to certain areas or items will never respawn

## Map changes:
 - Added a Rock Smash and a Strength Boulder to Route 115 that allows for easier backtracking to Meteor Falls
 - Moved the Sudowoodo in the Battle Frontier 1 tile up so it doesn't block the way to Artisan Cave. This is to deal with the fact that it can now respawn every day

# pokeemerald-expansion

## What is pokeemerald-expansion?

pokeemerald-expansion is a decomp hack base project based off pret's [pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) decompilation project. It's recommended that any new projects that plan on using it, to clone this repository instead of pret's vanilla repository, as we regurlarly incorporate pret's documentation changes. This is ***NOT*** a standalone romhack, and as such, most features will be unavailable and/or unbalanced if played as is.

If you use pokeemerald-expansion in your hack, please add RHH (Rom Hacking Hideout) to your credits list. Optionally, you can list the version used, so it can help players know what features to expect.
You can phrase it as the following:
```
Based off RHH's pokeemerald-expansion v1.8.0 https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/
```

## If I already have a project based on regular pokeemerald, can I use pokeemerald-expansion?
Yes! Keep in mind that we keep up with pret's documentation of pokeemerald, which means that if your project a bit old, you might get merge conflicts that you need to solve manually.
- If you haven't set up a remote, run the command `git remote add RHH https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion`.
- Once you have your remote set up, run the command `git pull RHH master`.

With this, you'll get the latest version of pokeemerald-expansion, plus a couple of bugfixes that haven't been released into the next patch version :)

## **How do I update my version of pokeemerald-expansion?**
- If you haven't set up a remote, run the command `git remote add RHH https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion`.
- Once you have your remote set up, run the command `git pull RHH expansion/1.8.1`.
