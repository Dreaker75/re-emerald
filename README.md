# Pokemon Re:Emerald
 - A QoL hack for Pokemon Emerald based on pokeemerald Expansion that tries to keep the essence of vanilla Emerald while at the same time fixing a lot of the outdated mechanics.
 - This hack will have all Pokemon, sprites, attacks, items, etc **as they appeared in vanilla Emerald** and only updates QoL stuff like breeding mechanics, EVs, etc.
 - This will be a 386-Romhack that will have repeatable methods to get every item in-game, will try to fix the Battle Frontier economy, and many other things.
 - The main focus of this hack is keeping the battle gameplay ideantical to vanilla Emerald. This means whatever strategies you used to beat the Battle Facilities on there will work here as well. This means no newer generation behaviors, stats, effects or anything like that. Pokemon will also have access to the same exact moves they did on Emerald, everything is just streamlined.
   - If at any point you notice that something doesn't line up with vanilla Emerald in this regard, and it's not document, do let me know as it might have been an oversight.

   - Here, you'll be able to see all the features I'm working on as I finish them.
   - IMPORTANT: These features will be added to the NEXT version release, you won't be able to play with these features until a new release is made. (My idea is to make new releases once enough features have been added and I feel like the new version would improve the gameplay significantly.)
