# Planned changes
Here, you can check out what my future plans are for this romhack. This list is not set in stone, but it's more of a guide for me to more easily remember what to focus on next.

I decided to change my approach to the features I implement. Instead of having a huge feature list for 3 different game releases, I'll list the features on different categories to try to have everything more organized. Doing it this way also means I can work on whatever I want to work on next and won't have to "push back" a feature. It will also hopefully make it easier to know if a feature you are interested in will make it to the hack.

### Important: Keep in mind that everything in this file is subject to change at any point. A feature being here doesn't mean it's guaranteed to happen.

## Updated mechanics
 - Change Synchronize to force Wild Pokemon to have the same nature as the Pokemon with Synchronize 100% of the time?
 - Roaming mechanic revamp to make it less tedious
 - Safari Zone revamp to make it less tedious and make PokeBlocks more useful
 - The Devon Scope will now show a message to the player when a Pokemon is holding an item (Except in the Battle Frontier). This function can be turned on or off from the Key Item menu
 - The Meteorite Key Item now allows to Forme change Deoxys (Professor Kozmo will give it back after researching it a bit)
 - Add Shiny breeding: Breeding a Shiny Pokemon will increase the chances of the offspring to be Shiny
 - Grab an item held by a defeated wild Pokemon automatically, no need to Thief it or the likes
 - Pressing L on the overworld will bring out a list of registered items (up to 10)

## Others

   - After revamping the Registered Items system, the player will instead have a single Bike that will have both functions, swapped by using Select.
 - Allow player to change name or gender/sprite at any point
 - Scott will now have a new reward for getting all Silver and Gold Symbols in the Battle Frontier. This is to make it easier to catch Celebi by having the berries elsewhere, but also serves as a boost to get players started on Shiny Hunting. The rewards now will be:
    - All Silver Symbols: A Shiny of the starter chosen
    - All Gold Symbols: A Shiny Ditto
 - Add a way to earn all missing Ribbons (Gift ribbons will have different text)
   - These Ribbons will be awarded for a big array of new features. Since this is something that would go entirely against the original Emerald's feeling (reusing the Shadow Pokemon and Mt. Battle ribbons), it's still up for debate whether it will be added to Re:Emerald or pushed to the Backlog.
 
# Backlog
Features here are things I'd like to add once everything else above has been implemented. Still debating whether to make these part of the base Re:Emerald or do it under a new name, as these are features that will significantly change the base of Pokemon Emerald.
 - Add a Battle Mode to the Battle Facilities that allows 1 Legendary Pokemon (Of BST 600+) to enter. All opponents in this mode will have at least 1 Legendary Pokemon on their teams, with longer streaks having enemies with 2 or even 3.
 - Add an ItemDex to track all the items obtained
 - Add an AttackDex to track all the attacks seen and used
 - Add a Pokemon Chaining mechanic to make it easier to find Pokemon with higher stats or Shinies. It will work differently than the DexNav or the PokeRadar
 - Add an AreaDex that will show everything available in an area, from Pokemon and Items to trades and gift the player has not yet received
 - Add Achievements that will be akin to B2W2 Medals
 - Add the Fame Checker into the game
