# Choice Pokemon
These Pokemon are available in Re:Emerald, but cannot be obtained in the same file without trading yet.
- Starter Pokemon:
    - Treecko -> Grovyle -> Sceptile
    - Torchic -> Combusken -> Blaziken
    - Mudkip -> Marshtomp -> Swampert
- Roamer Pokemon:
    - Latias
    - Latios

# Trade-only Pokemon
Due to being locked behind filling the Hoenn Dex, these Pokemon can only be obtained by trading the missing starters and Lati@s from another Re:Emerald save file at the moment (v 0.1.0). You also get a choice between each of these, so you would need 3 full hoenn dex save files to get all 3:
- Chikorita -> Bayleef -> Meganium
- Cyndaquil -> Quilava -> Typhlosion
- Totodile -> Croconaw -> Feraligatr
