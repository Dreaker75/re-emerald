# Planned changes
Here, you can check out what my future plans are for this romhack. Stuff here will change as I implement or figure out stuff. This is not a list set in stone, but rather a helpful list to keep everything more organized.

### Important: Keep in mind that everything in this file is subject to change at any point. A feature being here doesn't mean it's guaranteed to happen.

## Features for Alpha release
 - Strength boulders will remain in their place once the puzzle has been solved

 - Updated Battle Frontier prizes and BP economy
 - Bag expansion: Make it possible to store at least 1 of each item in the bag, and up to 999 of each item in a single slot
 - Update Battle Tent rewards
 - Add a counter for buying PokeBlocks in the Lillycove Department Store, like Platinum
 - Automatically put items picked up by Pick Up in the bag, and make it possible to pick up items even while the Pokemon is already holding an item
 - Make it possible to buy Coins in any amount in the Game Corner
 - Give an option to make the text display instant
 - Revamp Feebas mechanic: It will still appear on specific tiles, but these tiles will be the same for everyone based on its Pokedex description

 - Remove the catching and PokeNave tutorial
 - Change the Bullet Seed TM NPC (And Roxanne's) dialogue to account for TMs being reusable now
 - Change the Cut HM NPC dialogue to account for HMs being forgettable normally now and being unnecessary to use the move (Still debating whether to make having the HMs required to be able to use the move outside of battle)
 - Change the dialogue from the Fallarbor NPC that's digging a hole to mention the Diglett

## Features for Beta release

## Backlog
Features here are things I'd like to add once everything else above has been implemented. Still debating whether to make these part of the base Re:Emerald or do it under a new name, as these are features that will significantly change the base of Pokemon Emerald.
 - Add the Fame Checker into the game
 - Add an ItemDex to track all the items obtained
 - Add an AttackDex to track all the attacks seen and used
 - Add a Pokemon Chaining mechanic to make it easier to find Pokemon with higher stats or Shinies. It will work differently than the DexNave
 - Add an AreaDex that will show everything available in an area, from Pokemon and Items to trades and gift the player has not yet received
 - Add Achievements that will be akin to B2W2 Medals
