# Planned changes
Here, you can check out what my future plans are for this romhack. Stuff here will change as I implement or figure out stuff. This is not a list set in stone, but rather a helpful list to keep everything more organized.

### Important: Keep in mind that everything in this file is subject to change at any point. A feature being here doesn't mean it's guaranteed to happen.

## Features for Alpha release
 - Add version number on the Main Menu
 - Make Fly usable from the PokeNav map and allow flying to every location, not just towns
 - Make Teleport work like the old Fly
 - Give an option to make the text display instant
 - Change Hidden and PokeBall items found throughout the game to be more useful
 - Cut down on the Pokemon Center Dialogue

## Features for Beta release
 - Either turn off PokeNav calls completely or make it an in-game toggle
 - Make it possible to buy Coins in any amount in the Game Corner

 - Have an option to Register Sweet Scent like a Key Item
 - Make rest houses on the Safari Zone more interesting by giving items or other things
 - Add stuff to Scorched Slab to make it more interesting (could add a whole new dungeon like ORAS)
 - Add stuff to Slateport Museum to make it useful to visit after Team Aqua has been defeated
 - Add a prize for beating the Cycling Road record the first time, and a lesser prize for every time it's beaten afterwards
 - Add trainers and other things to Seafloor Cavern post-game, kind of like Mt. Chimney after the Team Aqua vs Team Magma face off
 - Display the Pokemon's EVs, IVs and Friendship in the status screen
 - Improve berry planting by making the berry yields 2-5 berries (depending on type) minimum, with more being given when watered during growth. Also make the fully grown berry plants remain harvestable until they're claimed

## Backlog
Features here are things I'd like to add once everything else above has been implemented. Still debating whether to make these part of the base Re:Emerald or do it under a new name, as these are features that will significantly change the base of Pokemon Emerald.
 - Add a Battle Mode to the Battle Facilities that allows 1 Legendary Pokemon (Of BST 600+) to enter. All player in this mode will have at least 1 Legendary Pokemon on their teams, with longer streaks having enemies with 2 or even 3.
 - Add an ItemDex to track all the items obtained
 - Add an AttackDex to track all the attacks seen and used
 - Add a Pokemon Chaining mechanic to make it easier to find Pokemon with higher stats or Shinies. It will work differently than the DexNav or the PokeRadar
 - Add an AreaDex that will show everything available in an area, from Pokemon and Items to trades and gift the player has not yet received
 - Add Achievements that will be akin to B2W2 Medals
 - Add the Fame Checker into the game
